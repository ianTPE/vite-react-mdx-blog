# My First Blog Post

This is my first blog post using Vite, React, and MDX.

## MDX Features

MDX allows you to use React components directly in your markdown:

```jsx
<Demo />
```

## Code Highlighting

MDX also supports code highlighting:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function getUser(id: number): User {
  // Implementation here
  return {
    id,
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  };
}
```

## Interactive Components

Below is a custom component made specifically for this blog post:

<Demo />

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful way to create interactive blog posts with React components.
